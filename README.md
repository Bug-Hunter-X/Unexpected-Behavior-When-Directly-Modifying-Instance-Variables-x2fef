This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Ruby: directly manipulating instance variables using `instance_variable_set` or `instance_variable_get`. This can lead to difficult-to-debug issues and break encapsulation. The example shows how this approach can bypass designed method access controls and lead to unpredictable results.  The solution shows how to refactor using appropriate setter/getter methods.
